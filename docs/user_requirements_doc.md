## 2. User Identification

### Primary Users
**Web Programming II Students:** Undergraduate and graduate students (ages 18-35) with varying technical expertise. Primary activities include project submission, peer review, resource access, and collaboration.

**Course Instructors:** Faculty and teaching assistants with high technical proficiency. Primary activities include project assessment, resource management, student progress monitoring, and content creation.

### Secondary Users
**Peer Students:** Students from related courses seeking reference materials and project examples.

**Academic Administrators:** Department heads and coordinators requiring platform oversight and usage analytics.

**External Reviewers:** Industry professionals and guest lecturers for project evaluation and talent identification.

## 3. Key User Needs and Problems

### 3.1 Project Showcase and Discovery
**Problem:** Students cannot effectively present work or discover quality project examples.  
**Need:** Intuitive gallery system with multimedia content, live demos, and searchable metadata for easy project discovery.

### 3.2 Secure Access Management
**Problem:** Existing solutions lack proper access controls or require complex authentication.  
**Need:** User-friendly authentication system with role-based access control, allowing instructor permission management while maintaining student ownership.

### 3.3 File and Resource Management
**Problem:** Difficulties organizing, uploading, and managing project files and materials.  
**Need:** Comprehensive file management with multi-format support, bulk uploads, folder organization, and storage quota management.

### 3.4 Version Control and History
**Problem:** Students lose previous work versions and cannot track project evolution.  
**Need:** Integrated version control maintaining project history, enabling rollbacks and collaboration without requiring deep technical knowledge.

### 3.5 Content Search and Discovery
**Problem:** Users cannot efficiently locate specific projects, resources, or materials.  
**Need:** Advanced search with filters for project type, technology stack, completion date, author, and tag-based categorization.

### 3.6 Collaborative Assessment
**Problem:** Disconnected assessment processes don't leverage digital submissions effectively.  
**Need:** Built-in assessment tools for structured feedback, rubric-based evaluations, peer review, and integrated grade tracking.
